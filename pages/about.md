# A Little Bit About Me
Hello and thank you for visiting my website! I want to share with you a little bit about myself and on my journey to becoming a mental health counselor. I believe finding the right mental health counselor to meet your mental health needs is important, so I hope this page provides a small glimpse into who I am and my background my as a mental health provider.

Born and raised in Wisconsin, I grew up in a traditional Midwestern family environment that fostered the concept of “being nice and doing good” for others. As such, I have always had a passion for helping others. Throughout my time in high school and college, this passion strengthened as I enjoyed listening to other’s stories and arriving at solutions to help resolve problematic experiences. Since my first year in college, I haved worked as an advisor (student and professional) to improve my listening and interpersonal abilities that would lead me to being a successful therapist someday. These advisor positions provided the opportunity to gain confidence in working with individuals and motivating them to develop their personal resources, abilities, and resiliency.

After graduating from the University of Wisconsin – Madison in 2014 with a Bachelor’s in Communication Arts (Rhetoric & Human Behavior), I was determined to jumpstart my career as a mental health counselor. I attended the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater to complete my Master’s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling with emphasis in Marriage & Family Therapy. Although my bank account history would disagree, my experiential and academic learning in my graduate program was priceless and has given me the tools I have desired to be a competent and skilled mental health counselor. Today, I find myself knowing what it means to “be nice and do good” for others and am determined to provide quality and meaningful service to clients and couples who are seeking therapy to overcome issues and/or learn about themselves.

In addition to counseling, I enjoy a variety of activities. You will likely catch me running and biking around town or enjoying a nice cold beer outside. I am a fan of video gaming, particularly the RPG/Adventure genre (don’t get me started on the greatness of Final Fantasy games…). I also like to keep up-to-date with new shows and movies, primarily on Netflix and HBO (so if you have suggestions, let me know!). Finally, I am an avid learner and am determined to continue my education in areas unfamiliar to me. Currently, I am making attempts to learn new languages and computer programming. We’ll see how that goes!

While this page cannot share everything about me, I hope it has provided you some background as who I am as a mental health counselor and person.
