# Counseling Services

My goal and hopes as a mental health counselor is to provide quality and meaningful service that fits your mental health needs and/or goals. I aim to provide individual and couples counseling at a fair rate. This page is designed to provide some information on my counseling services and inform you of my guiding counseling approach and techniques. 

## My Counseling Approach & Techniques

I take an integrative person-centered approach to counseling with a focus on relationship-building and culture appreciation. I feel everyone has a great and unique story and background that deserves to be heard. Additionally, I view that desired change happens within individuals and that counseling services can unlock a person’s power to be the agent of their own change. My counseling services focus on you and your abilities to be confident with yourself, achieve your goals, and make your desired changes.

While my philosophy may be rooted in person-centered related approaches, I often use cognitive-behavioral techniques (CBT) to target change in your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. These techniques involve challenges to your perceptions and assigning personal homework and resources to achieve your counseling goals. Combined with a person-centered approach, my hope is that you feel heard, helped, and empowered in order to make the changes you want to see from counseling.

Of course, there is no “one-size fits all” counseling approaches or techniques. Therefore, I am open to hearing your feedback on my approach and making adjustments as necessary for you to accomplish your counseling goals. My counseling education has provided me the necessary theories and tools to make sure that your counseling experience is helpful and meaningful.

## Individual Counseling Sessions

As a licensed counselor, I provide individual psychotherapy sessions for folks seeking to make personal change and/or overcome difficult personal experiences. I have experience working with the following issues:

*	Depression/Anxiety/Stress
*	Transitions & changes
* Grief/loss
* Self-esteem, self-confidence, self-image
* Trauma processing
* LGBTQ+-related issues
* Cultural issues
* Issues related to masculinity 
* Sex & sexuality
* Career-related issues

Of course, I am always looking to make this list grow! I am open to working with a variety of individuals and working together to resolve whatever your personal issue may be. My mission as a counselor is to provide a quality safe space for clients to be open and deeply engaged with the counseling process. I aim to be a sex and kink-positive, LGBTQ+-friendly and multicultural competent counselor in order to truly understand my clients’ experiences and foster an environment that makes you work towards accomplishing your therapeutic goals.

If you are located elsewhere in Wisconsin and unable to attend an in-person session, please do not hesitate to inquire about distance counseling sessions. Unfortunately, I am not currently able to provide counseling services to out-of-state individuals.

## Couples/Partner(s)/Relationship Counseling

As a licensed marriage & family therapist, I aim to provide worthwhile couples/partners counseling services. I am happy to work with you and your partner on a variety of relationship-related issues, such as communication and conflict-resolution. While I do not currently provide sex counseling, I am happy and feel comfortable to explore sexual issues between partners and the underlying issues that create them. Finally, I have experience with polyamorous partnerships and open to exploring issues surrounding poly-partnerships.

Of course, I am always looking to make this list of experiences grow! I am open to working with a variety of couples and working together to resolve whatever your partnership issues may be. My mission as a counselor is to provide a quality safe space for clients to be open and deeply engaged with the counseling process. I aim to be a sex and kink-positive, LGBTQ+-friendly and multicultural competent counselor in order to truly understand my clients’ experiences and foster an environment that makes you work towards accomplishing your therapeutic goals.

## Why I do not take insurance

I have made the choice to accept only client payment for services. By paying directly for mental health counseling, clients receive complete privacy as insurance would require that your information become part of your health record. As the client, you would also retain control over your treatment in terms of duration and frequency (most insurance companies only allow a specific set of sessions based on a diagnosis). By paying directly, a third party is not making decisions about your care and you remain in control of your mental health treatment.

Unfortunately, insurance companies will not pay for psychotherapy unless the counselor makes a diagnosis. While I will make a diagnosis if clinically necessary, I would like to provide counseling services to any and all people without promoting a the stigma of illness for those seeking therapy to manage personal challenges or problems. I do not wish to give someone a diagnosis simply for insurance companies.
